# Invoice App

This application contains my implementation of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl/hub)
challenge. The project acts as a way of learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
bit by bit.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version installed on
your local machine. I recommed [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install
node.

## Development

Following scripts are currently supported:

### Development server

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### Production build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Run production build

```sh
$ npm run start
```

### Check linting issues

```sh
$ npm run lint
```
